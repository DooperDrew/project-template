# Project Kickstart Documentation System

This directory contains the specification and governance documents that define the lifecycle of a software project built with the **Project Kickstart** methodology.

In an agent-assisted or autonomous engineering environment, **the codebase specifications are the primary interface between human intent and AI execution**. Keeping technical truth in version-controlled markdown files prevents context drift, hallucinated constraints, architectural fragmentation, and abandoned conventions.

## 📚 Specification Hierarchy & Reading Order

Whenever an agent or developer enters the workspace, documents must be consulted in this exact sequence before any code is generated or modified:

## 🗂️ Document Inventory

| File | Purpose | Key Content & Conventions |
|---|---|---|
| [`01-vision.md`](01-vision.md) | **North Star** | Problem statement, targeted user personas, core guiding principles in priority order, and explicit non-goals. |
| [`02-requirements.md`](02-requirements.md) | **Functional & Non-Functional Specs** | MoSCoW-prioritized features (`F1`, `F2`), quantitative non-functional budgets (`NFR-P1` latency, memory, CPU), and safety requirements. |
| [`03-architecture.md`](03-architecture.md) | **Structural Blueprint** | Tech stack selection, Mermaid component diagrams, directory boundaries designed for parallel agent execution, and key designs. |
| [`04-ux.md`](04-ux.md) | **Interaction Model** | UI screens, state diagrams (empty/loading/error/success), entry points (CLI/desktop/web), keyboard shortcuts, accessibility, and i18n rules. |
| [`05-roadmap.md`](05-roadmap.md) | **Single Source of Truth for Work** | Phased milestones (M0 through M7). Parallel tasks marked with `⇉`. Checked off with date and git commit ID upon verification. |
| [`06-qa-and-validation.md`](06-qa-and-validation.md) | **Empirical Proof & Test Matrices** | Empirical measurements of NFR budgets, real-environment hardware/manual QA matrices, edge case regressions, and incident reporting. |
| [`m0-spike-findings.md`](m0-spike-findings.md) | **Spike Ground Truth** | Empirical results and terminal outputs from Milestone 0 diagnostic spikes, de-risking APIs and hardware before core development. |

## 🔬 Core Working Agreements for Documentation

### 1. Claims Follow Evidence
Never write assertions into technical documents that have not been tested or measured.
- If an architectural assumption is unproven, mark it with **🔬 (spike)**.
- In [`06-qa-and-validation.md`](06-qa-and-validation.md), rows remain **`Pending`** until empirical evidence (date, test log, tester, hardware) is produced.
- Do not use marketing buzzwords ("pioneering", "blazing fast", "zero bugs") in technical specs.

### 2. Living Knowledge Loop
When a developer corrects a design or an agent makes a mistake:
1. Do not merely apologize or fix the code in isolation.
2. Record the root cause and the new preventative rule in [`lessons-learned.md`](lessons-learned.md).
3. If the rule is universally binding across all conversations, promote it to [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) and [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](../.github/copilot-instructions.md).

### 3. Disjoint Modules for Parallel Workers
[`03-architecture.md`](03-architecture.md) enforces that independent components live in separated directories (e.g., `core/`, `platform/`, `ui/`). This enables multi-agent swarms (`project-worker` subagents and GitHub Copilot Agent) to work concurrently in isolated git worktrees or branches without causing merge conflicts.

## 🛠️ Bootstrapping a New Project

When you initialize a project from this template:
1. Run the `/project-kickstart` skill with an Antigravity agent or answer the discovery interview questions.
2. The agent fills each template placeholder (`{{PROJECT_NAME}}`, `{{...}}`) with specific domain requirements.
3. Review and approve the generated draft specs in `docs/`.
4. Run Milestone 0 spikes to de-risk unknown APIs or hardware requirements and document findings in [`m0-spike-findings.md`](m0-spike-findings.md).
5. Transition the roadmap into active execution!
